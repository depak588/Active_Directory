Download and Install Virtual Box or VMware, I am using Vmware Pro.

Download Windows Server 2022 and install it as Standard Eval and name it as Base Domain Controller or anything and then snapshot of the machine as Fresh Install.

Download Windows 11 iso and install it and signin using Domain join button in the School or Work SignIn Option and name it as Local_Admin and set a password.

(Note: Install VMware tools on both the machines and and then take snapshot of both as Fresh Install).
